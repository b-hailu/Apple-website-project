<h2>Steps to write HTML code with CSS</h2> 
1. Create or choose the HTML structure Which element or container you are using <br>
2. name the container; naming is used to select specific element <br>
    There are two ways to name with id and class <br>
3. After naming, we select specific naming by their id, class, type, and by using descending selecter <br>
    If we want to call by id we use # before the name <br>
    If we want to call by class, we use .(dot) before the name <br>
    If you want to call by type, we use the element like header <br>
    If you want to target each element at the same time and the same style use * <br>
    descending selector help us to get a child. example #name div
